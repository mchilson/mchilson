### Welcome! :v:
#### Hi, and welcome to my Github repository. I am a freelance developer with 37 years experience living in Birmingham, Alabama, USA :statue_of_liberty:. I specialize in Ruby, PHP, R, and PROLOG. Most of the code here on github is my personal experimentation with various languages, algorithms, tools, and a few small open-cource projects. :blush:
 
**Skills** :hammer: HTML / CSS / JS / RUBY / PHP / R LANG / PROLOG / SQL
